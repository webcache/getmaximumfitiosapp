# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables
   
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your values:
   
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit the `.env` file with your Firebase credentials and other configuration values.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive configuration like API keys and Firebase credentials. These are stored in the `.env` file which is not committed to the repository for security reasons.

### Required Environment Variables

- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase API key
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`: Firebase authentication domain
- `FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`: Firebase database URL
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: Firebase storage bucket
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`: Firebase messaging sender ID
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Firebase application ID
- `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`: Firebase measurement ID (for Google Analytics)

### Using Environment Variables

To use an environment variable in your code:

```javascript
import { FIREBASE_API_KEY } from '@env';

console.log(FIREBASE_API_KEY);
```
