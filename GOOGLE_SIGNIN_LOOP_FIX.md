# GOOGLE SIGN-IN LOOP FIX

## Problem Identified
The app was experiencing an infinite redirect loop between the login screen and dashboard after successful Google Sign-In. The issue was caused by **dual authentication systems** - the old `AuthContext` and the new Redux-based authentication system.

## Root Cause
1. **Google Sign-In succeeded** in Firebase and updated the Redux authentication state
2. **Dashboard used old `useAuth()` hook** which returned `null` for user because it was looking at the old AuthContext
3. **Dashboard immediately redirected** back to login screen when it saw `user` as `null`
4. **Login screen** would then process the successful Google Sign-In again, creating an infinite loop

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Google Sign-In Flow in Redux System
- **Updated `hooks/useAuthFunctions.ts`**: Added `signInWithGoogle()` method that integrates with Redux state
- **Updated `components/SocialAuthButtons.tsx`**: 
  - Now uses Redux-integrated Google Sign-In instead of direct utility function
  - Added proper state monitoring with `useEffect` to wait for authentication state updates
  - Added safety timeout (10 seconds) to prevent hanging
  - Removed reliance on timing-based `setTimeout` for success detection

### 2. Updated All Screens to Use Redux Authentication
**Fixed the following files to use `useReduxAuth()` instead of old `useAuth()`:**
- âœ… `app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx` - **CRITICAL FIX** - This was the main cause of the loop
- âœ… `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added `refreshUserProfile` function to Redux system
- âœ… `app/(tabs)/progress.tsx`
- âœ… `app/(tabs)/workouts.tsx` 
- âœ… `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
- âœ… `app/myExercises.tsx`
- âœ… `app/exerciseDetail.tsx`
- âœ… `app/manageFavorites.tsx`
- âœ… `app/login/loginScreen.tsx` - Already using Redux (correct)
- âœ… `app/index.tsx` - Already using Redux (correct)

### 3. Added Missing Redux Auth Functions
- **Added `refreshUserProfile()`** to `useAuthFunctions` hook for profile management
- **Enhanced state monitoring** in `SocialAuthButtons` with proper React effects
- **Added comprehensive logging** for debugging authentication flow

## Technical Implementation

### Google Sign-In Flow (Fixed)
```typescript
// Before (causing loop):
SocialAuthButtons -> signInWithGoogle() -> Firebase success -> onSuccess() called immediately
Dashboard -> useAuth() returns null -> redirect to login -> LOOP

// After (working):
SocialAuthButtons -> useAuthFunctions.signInWithGoogle() -> Firebase success + Redux update
-> useEffect monitors isAuthenticated -> calls onSuccess when state updates
Dashboard -> useReduxAuth() gets user -> stays on dashboard âœ…
```

### State Monitoring Pattern
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (waitingForAuth && isAuthenticated && user) {
    setWaitingForAuth(false);
    setLoadingGoogle(false);
    onSuccess?.();
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user, waitingForAuth, onSuccess]);
```

## Testing Results Expected

After these fixes:
1. **Google Sign-In** should work seamlessly without loops
2. **All screens** now use consistent Redux authentication state
3. **Navigation flow** should be: Login â†’ Google auth â†’ Dashboard (stay)
4. **Token persistence** should work across app restarts
5. **No more redirect loops** between login and dashboard

## Key Changes Summary

1. **ðŸ”§ Fixed dual auth system** - All screens now use Redux instead of old AuthContext
2. **ðŸ”§ Enhanced Google Sign-In integration** - Proper Redux state integration
3. **ðŸ”§ Added state monitoring** - React useEffect properly waits for auth state
4. **ðŸ”§ Added safety mechanisms** - Timeout protection and comprehensive logging
5. **ðŸ”§ Unified authentication flow** - Single source of truth for auth state

The app should now have a robust, loop-free Google Sign-In experience with proper token persistence and state management across all screens.
