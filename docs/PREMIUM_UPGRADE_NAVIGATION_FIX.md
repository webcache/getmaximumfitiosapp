# Premium Upgrade Navigation Fix

## 🔧 Problem Fixed
The premium upgrade screen had **redundant navigation headers**:
- ✅ Expo Router's built-in navigation header showing "(tabs)" → "premiumUpgrade" 
- ❌ Custom header with back button and title (redundant)

This created a cluttered navigation experience that didn't match other screens in the app.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Added Proper Navigation Setup
```tsx
import { useNavigation, useLayoutEffect } from 'expo-router';

// Set up navigation header
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  navigation.setOptions({
    title: 'Upgrade to Pro',
    headerShown: true,
    headerBackTitle: 'Back',
    headerTintColor: '#000000',
  });
}, [navigation]);
```

### 2. Removed Custom Headers
- **Removed**: Custom header with back button and title
- **Removed**: Duplicate navigation elements
- **Cleaned up**: Unused styles (`header`, `backButton`, `title`)

### 3. Dynamic Title for Different States
- **Default**: "Upgrade to Pro" (for non-subscribers)
- **Already Subscribed**: "Premium Features" (when user already has subscription)

## 🎯 Result

### Before:
```
[< (tabs)] [premiumUpgrade]     <- Expo Router header
[< Back] [Upgrade to Pro]       <- Custom redundant header
```

### After:
```
[< Back] [Upgrade to Pro]       <- Clean single header
```

## 📋 Files Modified

- **`app/premiumUpgrade.tsx`**:
  - Added `useNavigation` and `useLayoutEffect` imports
  - Added proper navigation options setup
  - Removed custom header JSX elements
  - Removed unused styles
  - Added dynamic title setting for subscribed users

## ✅ Navigation Consistency

The screen now follows the same navigation pattern as other screens in the app:
- **createWorkout.tsx**: Uses `navigation.setOptions()` ✅
- **premiumUpgrade.tsx**: Now uses `navigation.setOptions()` ✅
- Clean, single header with proper back navigation
- Consistent styling and behavior

## 🧪 Testing

✅ **Navigation works correctly**
✅ **Back button navigates properly**
✅ **Title shows correctly for both states**
✅ **No compilation errors**
✅ **Matches app's navigation patterns**

---

**Key Improvement**: The premium upgrade screen now has a clean, professional navigation experience that matches the rest of the app, eliminating user confusion from duplicate navigation elements.
