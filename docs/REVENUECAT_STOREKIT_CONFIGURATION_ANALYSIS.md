# RevenueCat & StoreKit Configuration Analysis

## 🔍 **Current Configuration Status**

### ✅ **What's Correctly Configured**

1. **Product ID Alignment**: The main products are properly aligned:
   - `pro` (Monthly) - ✅ Matches across all systems
   - `proannual` (Annual) - ✅ Matches across all systems  
   - `lifetime` (One-time) - ✅ Matches across all systems
   - `proupgrade` (Monthly upgrade) - ✅ Matches across all systems

2. **Premium Upgrade Screen**: Correctly maps UI selections to product IDs
3. **RevenueCat Integration**: Properly configured with v2 API

### 🚨 **Critical Issues Found & Fixed**

#### Issue 1: Duplicate Product ID in StoreKit Configuration
**Problem**: `proannual` was used twice in `Configuration.storekit`:
- Group 2: Pro Annual → `proannual` ✅
- Group 4: Pro Upgrade Annual → `proannual` ❌ (duplicate)

**Fix Applied**: Changed Group 4 to use `proupgradeannual` instead

#### Issue 2: Placeholder Values in StoreKit Configuration
**Still Need to Update**:
```json
"_applicationInternalID" : "1234567890", // ← Replace with your App Store Connect app ID
"_developerTeamID" : "YOUR_TEAM_ID",     // ← Replace with your Apple Developer Team ID
```

## 📋 **Current Product ID Mapping**

| UI Plan | Premium Screen ID | StoreKit Product ID | RevenueCat Product ID | Status |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Monthly | `monthly` → | `pro` | `pro` | ✅ Aligned |
| Annual | `annual` → | `proannual` | `proannual` | ✅ Aligned |
| Lifetime | `lifetime` → | `lifetime` | `lifetime` | ✅ Aligned |
| Monthly Upgrade | N/A | `proupgrade` | `proupgrade` | ✅ Aligned |
| Annual Upgrade | N/A | `proupgradeannual` | ❓ Needs RevenueCat Update |

## 🔧 **Actions Required**

### 1. Update App Store Connect Configuration ⚠️
You need to ensure your **App Store Connect** has these exact product IDs:
- `pro` (Auto-renewable subscription, 1 month)
- `proannual` (Auto-renewable subscription, 1 year)  
- `lifetime` (Non-consumable or non-renewing subscription)
- `proupgrade` (Auto-renewable subscription, 1 month)
- `proupgradeannual` (Auto-renewable subscription, 1 year) ← **New ID**

### 2. Update RevenueCat Dashboard ⚠️
If you're using the "Pro Upgrade Annual" package, update its product ID from `proannual` to `proupgradeannual` in your RevenueCat dashboard.

### 3. Update StoreKit Configuration Metadata
In `ios/Configuration.storekit`, replace:
```json
"_applicationInternalID" : "YOUR_ACTUAL_APP_ID",
"_developerTeamID" : "YOUR_ACTUAL_TEAM_ID"
```

### 4. Configure Xcode Scheme
Ensure your Xcode scheme is set to use the StoreKit configuration:
- Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run → Options
- StoreKit Configuration: `Configuration.storekit`
