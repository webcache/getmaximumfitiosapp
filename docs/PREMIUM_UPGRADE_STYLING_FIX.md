# Premium Upgrade Styling Fix - Radio Button Overlap

## ðŸ”§ Problem Identified
The savings labels ("44%" and "Best value") were overlapping with the radio buttons on the pricing options. This was caused by:

1. **Layout Conflict**: The `pricingHeader` used `justifyContent: 'space-between'` which pushed the savings text to the far right
2. **Positioning Conflict**: Radio buttons were positioned `absolute` at `top: 20, right: 20`
3. **No Space Allocation**: The layout didn't account for the radio button space

### Before (Issue):
```
[Pro Annual]  <------------>  [44%] ðŸ”˜  <- Overlapping
```

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Restructured Layout
**Changed from**: Horizontal layout with space-between
```tsx
<View style={styles.pricingHeader}>
  <Text style={styles.pricingTitle}>{option.title}</Text>
  {option.savings && (
    <Text style={styles.savingsText}>{option.savings}</Text>
  )}
</View>
```

**Changed to**: Vertical stacked layout
```tsx
<View style={styles.pricingHeader}>
  <View style={styles.titleAndSavings}>
    <Text style={styles.pricingTitle}>{option.title}</Text>
    {option.savings && (
      <Text style={styles.savingsText}>{option.savings}</Text>
    )}
  </View>
</View>
```

### 2. Updated Styles

#### Added `titleAndSavings` container:
```tsx
titleAndSavings: {
  flexDirection: 'column',
  alignItems: 'flex-start',
},
```

#### Updated `pricingHeader`:
- Removed `justifyContent: 'space-between'`
- Added `marginRight: 40` to make room for radio button
- Changed `alignItems` to `flex-start`

#### Improved `savingsText`:
- Reduced font size: `14` â†’ `12`
- Added `marginTop: 2` for better spacing

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

### After (Fixed):
```
[Pro Annual]          ðŸ”˜
[44%]
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… No overlap between savings text and radio buttons
- âœ… Clean vertical layout for title and savings
- âœ… Proper spacing for radio button interaction
- âœ… Better visual hierarchy

## ðŸ“‹ Files Modified

- **`app/premiumUpgrade.tsx`**:
  - Restructured pricing option JSX layout
  - Added `titleAndSavings` style container
  - Updated `pricingHeader` styles
  - Improved `savingsText` typography and spacing

## ðŸ§ª Testing

âœ… **No overlap between savings labels and radio buttons**
âœ… **Radio buttons are fully clickable**
âœ… **Clean visual hierarchy maintained**
âœ… **Responsive layout works on different screen sizes**

---

**Key Improvement**: The pricing options now have a clean, professional layout where the savings labels are positioned below the plan titles, eliminating any overlap with the radio button selection area.
