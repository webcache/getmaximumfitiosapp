## 🚀 Migration Steps

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Test First**: Run dry-run migration to preview changes
2. **Migrate Data**: Copy data to new subcollection location
3. **Verify**: Test app functionality with new data structure
4. **Deploy Rules**: Update Firestore security rules
5. **Cleanup**: Optionally delete old data after verification

### Commands:
```bash
# 1. Preview migration
./scripts/migrate-feature-usage.sh  # Choose option 1

# 2. Run migration
./scripts/migrate-feature-usage.sh  # Choose option 2

# 3. Test app thoroughly, then cleanup
./scripts/migrate-feature-usage.sh  # Choose option 3
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Data Organization**: All user data under `profiles/{userId}`
2. **Simplified GDPR Compliance**: Automatic deletion with user profile
3. **Consistent Architecture**: Follows subcollection pattern
4. **Cleaner Security Rules**: Single pattern for all user data
5. **Future-Proof**: Easier to maintain and extend

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No Backward Compatibility**: Old app versions won't work after rule deployment
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify feature gating works correctly
- **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any Firestore permission errors
- **Deploy Rules**: Don't forget to deploy updated Firestore rules
