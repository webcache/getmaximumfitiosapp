# RevenueCat Development Setup

## Overview
This guide helps resolve the RevenueCat configuration warnings you see during development.

## What The Warnings Mean

### Normal Development Warnings ‚úÖ
These warnings are **EXPECTED** during development:
```
[RevenueCat] üçé‚ÄºÔ∏è Error fetching offerings - The operation couldn't be completed
There's a problem with your configuration. None of the products registered in the RevenueCat dashboard could be fetched from App Store Connect
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Products aren't approved in App Store Connect yet
- StoreKit Configuration file needs setup
- Development environment differs from production

## Quick Fixes

### 1. Reduce Log Noise
The app now uses `LOG_LEVEL.WARN` in development to reduce console noise while showing important warnings.

### 2. StoreKit Configuration (Recommended)
We've created `ios/Configuration.storekit` for local testing:

```json
// ios/Configuration.storekit contains:
- Premium Monthly: com.getmaximumfit.premium.monthly
- Premium Yearly: com.getmaximumfit.premium.yearly
```

**To use this:**
1. Open your iOS project in Xcode
2. Go to your scheme settings (Product ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Edit Scheme)
3. Select "Run" in the left panel
4. Go to "Options" tab
5. Under "StoreKit Configuration", select "Configuration.storekit"

### 3. App Behavior During Development
The app is designed to work gracefully without RevenueCat:

- ‚úÖ App starts normally
- ‚úÖ Feature gating defaults to free tier
- ‚úÖ No crashes or blocking errors
- ‚úÖ Helpful development messages

## Development Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Normal Development Behavior
- [x] App starts without crashes
- [x] Console shows: "Development mode - no offerings available"
- [x] Feature gating works with free tier limits
- [x] Subscription features are disabled gracefully

### üß™ Testing Subscriptions (Optional)
If you want to test actual purchases:

1. **Create Sandbox Account**:
   - Go to App Store Connect
   - Users and Access ‚Üí Sandbox Testers
   - Create test account

2. **Set up Products**:
   - App Store Connect ‚Üí My Apps ‚Üí In-App Purchases
   - Create products matching your StoreKit configuration

3. **Test on Device**:
   - Sign out of App Store on device
   - Run app, try to purchase
   - Sign in with sandbox account when prompted

## Understanding The Console Output

### ‚úÖ Expected Messages (Normal)
```
üè™ RevenueCat configured for development with v2 API
‚ÑπÔ∏è StoreKit configuration warnings during development are normal
üîß Development: Continuing without offerings (subscription features disabled)
Development mode - no offerings available
```

### ‚ùå Problematic Messages (Fix Needed)
```
RevenueCat API key not properly configured
Failed to initialize RevenueCat
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` or configuration has:
```env
REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_v2_api_key_here
```

## Production vs Development

| Environment | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| **Development** | Graceful degradation, helpful warnings, no crashes |
| **Production** | Full RevenueCat integration, error-level logging only |

## Next Steps

1. **For Development**: Your app works correctly as-is
2. **For Production**: Set up products in App Store Connect
3. **For Testing**: Use the StoreKit configuration file

## Troubleshooting

### Still Seeing "Purchases instance already set"?
This indicates multiple RevenueCat initializations. The app now handles this gracefully.

### Want to test real purchases?
Use the StoreKit configuration file and sandbox accounts.

### App not working?
Check that:
- RevenueCat API key is set
- App starts without crashes
- Feature gating defaults to free tier
