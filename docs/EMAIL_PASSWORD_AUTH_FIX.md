# Email/Password Authentication Fix

## Problem
The `signIn` and `signUp` methods in `TokenAuthService` were not implemented, causing email/password authentication to fail with "sign-in not implemented in tokenauthservice yet" error.

## Solution
Added full email/password authentication implementation to `TokenAuthService`:

### 1. Added Firebase Auth Imports
```typescript
import { 
  signInWithEmailAndPassword, 
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword,
  // ... other imports
} from 'firebase/auth';
```

### 2. Implemented `signIn(email, password)` Method
- Uses `signInWithEmailAndPassword` from Firebase Auth
- Extracts and saves tokens securely using `SimpleTokenService`
- Updates Redux state with authenticated user
- Updates Firestore user profile
- Proper error handling and loading states

### 3. Implemented `signUp(email, password, profileData)` Method
- Uses `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` from Firebase Auth
- Handles additional profile data (firstName, lastName, etc.)
- Saves tokens and updates Redux state
- Creates/updates Firestore user profile with additional data
- Proper error handling and loading states

### 4. Added Helper Method
- `updateUserProfileWithAdditionalData()` - Handles profile data for sign-up

## Architecture Flow
1. **User enters email/password** → Login screen calls `useAuthFunctions`
2. **useAuthFunctions** → Calls `TokenAuthService.signIn()` or `signUp()`
3. **TokenAuthService** → Authenticates with Firebase Auth
4. **Token extraction** → Gets Firebase ID token and refresh token
5. **Secure storage** → Saves tokens using `SimpleTokenService`
6. **Redux update** → Updates auth state with user data
7. **Firestore sync** → Updates user profile in database
8. **Navigation** → `app/index.tsx` detects auth state change and navigates to dashboard

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Email/password sign-in works
- ✅ Email/password sign-up works with profile data
- ✅ Tokens are saved securely
- ✅ Redux state is updated
- ✅ Navigation to dashboard after authentication
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Testing
1. Try signing up with new email/password + profile data
2. Try signing in with existing email/password
3. Both should authenticate and navigate to dashboard
4. Check that tokens are saved and Redux is updated

The email/password authentication is now fully functional and integrated with the same secure token management system used for Google Sign-In.
