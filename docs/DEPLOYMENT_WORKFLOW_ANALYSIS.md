## 🔧 **Configuration Updates**

### 1. **EAS Submit Configuration** (`eas.json`)
**Added TestFlight submit profile:**
```json
"submit": {
  "preview": {
    "ios": {
      "appleId": "cash@getmaximumfreedomandfitness.com",
      "ascAppId": "6738156162"
    }
  },
  "production": {

      "appleId": "cash@getmaximumfreedomandfitness.com", 
      "ascAppId": "6738156162"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **GitHub Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`)
**Added TestFlight submission step:**
```yaml
- name: 🚀 Submit to TestFlight (Preview builds)
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' || (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && github.event.inputs.deployment_type == 'testflight')
  run: eas submit --platform ios --profile preview --latest --non-interactive
```

## 🧪 **How to Deploy to TestFlight**

### Method 1: **Push to Develop Branch**
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```
→ Automatically builds and submits to TestFlight

### Method 2: **Manual Workflow Dispatch**
1. Go to GitHub Actions in your repository
2. Click "iOS Build and Deploy"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "testflight" as deployment type
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Method 3: **Create Pull Request**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# Make changes
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR to main
```
→ Automatically builds and submits to TestFlight for testing

## 📱 **TestFlight Testing Process**

### 1. **After Successful Deployment:**
- Build appears in App Store Connect → TestFlight
- Add internal/external testers
- Distribute build to testers

### 2. **Testing Your In-App Purchases:**
- TestFlight builds use **Sandbox environment**
- Use your sandbox Apple ID for testing
- Test all subscription flows:
  - Purchase subscriptions
  - Restore purchases
  - Cancel and reactivate

### 3. **Verify RevenueCat Integration:**
- TestFlight builds will connect to RevenueCat production
- Ensure your RevenueCat dashboard products match your StoreKit configuration
- Test feature gating works correctly

## 🔍 **Monitoring Deployments**

### GitHub Actions:
- View deployment status in GitHub Actions tab
- Check build logs for any issues
- Monitor success/failure notifications

### App Store Connect:
- Check TestFlight section for new builds
- Monitor build processing status
- Review any compliance issues

### RevenueCat:
- Monitor sandbox transactions in RevenueCat dashboard
- Verify webhook configurations
- Check customer data flow

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### 1. **Test the New Workflow:**
```bash
# Option 1: Push to develop
git checkout develop
git push origin develop

# Option 2: Manual dispatch
# Use GitHub Actions UI with "testflight" option
```

### 2. **Verify TestFlight Submission:**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Confirm build appears in App Store Connect
- Test with your sandbox Apple ID

### 3. **Production Readiness:**
- Ensure all RevenueCat products are configured
- Remove debug components for production builds
- Test complete user flows in TestFlight

## 🎉 **Summary**

**Before**: Your workflow built iOS apps but only submitted production builds to App Store.

**Now**: Your workflow builds iOS apps AND submits:
- ✅ **Preview builds** → **TestFlight** (for testing)
- ✅ **Production builds** → **App Store** (for release)

You can now easily deploy to TestFlight for testing your in-app purchase integration! 🚀
