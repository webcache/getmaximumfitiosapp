# Navigation Fix After Google Sign-In

## Problem
After successful Google Sign-In, the app was not navigating to the dashboard. The issue was in the navigation logic in `app/index.tsx`.

## Root Cause
The navigation logic had a race condition:

1. First `useEffect`: Checks auth state, sets `hasNavigatedRef.current = true`, schedules navigation
2. Second `useEffect`: Detects auth state change, resets `hasNavigatedRef.current = false`
3. Navigation never happens because the flag gets reset

## Solution
Replaced the dual useEffect pattern with a single, more robust navigation effect:

### Before
```tsx
// Main navigation effect
useEffect(() => {
  // ... navigation logic
  hasNavigatedRef.current = true;
  // ... schedule navigation
}, [user, loading, initialized, isAuthenticated, persistenceRestored, router, isReady]);

// Separate effect that resets navigation flag
useEffect(() => {
  hasNavigatedRef.current = false; // This was causing the race condition
}, [isAuthenticated, user?.uid]);
```

### After
```tsx
// Single navigation effect with built-in auth state change detection
useEffect(() => {
  const authStateKey = `${isAuthenticated}-${user?.uid || 'none'}`;
  
  // Detect auth state changes and reset navigation flag accordingly
  if (currentAuthStateRef.current !== authStateKey) {
    hasNavigatedRef.current = false;
    currentAuthStateRef.current = authStateKey;
  }
  
  // ... rest of navigation logic
}, [user, loading, initialized, isAuthenticated, persistenceRestored, router, isReady]);
```

## Key Improvements
1. **Eliminated race condition**: No separate effect resetting the navigation flag
2. **Auth state tracking**: Uses `authStateKey` to detect when user actually changes
3. **Better logging**: More detailed logs to track navigation state changes
4. **Atomic updates**: Navigation flag reset and tracking happen in same effect

## Expected Behavior
- App starts: Shows loading screen
- No auth: Navigates to login screen
- Google Sign-In successful: Immediately navigates to dashboard
- User logs out: Navigates back to login screen
- User logs in again: Navigates to dashboard again

## Testing
1. Start fresh app (should go to login)
2. Sign in with Google (should go to dashboard)
3. Sign out (should go to login)
4. Sign in again (should go to dashboard)

The navigation should now work correctly in all scenarios.
