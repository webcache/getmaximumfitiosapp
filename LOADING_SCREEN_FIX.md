# Loading Screen Issue Fix

## Problem
The app was stuck on the loading/splash screen after recent navigation changes. Users couldn't reach the login screen because the main navigation logic was completely disabled.

## Root Cause
In `app/index.tsx`, the navigation logic was disabled with an early return:
```typescript
// TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Let login screen handle navigation to avoid conflicts
console.log('⏸️ INDEX: Navigation temporarily disabled to prevent conflicts with login screen');
return; // <-- This caused the app to never navigate anywhere
```

## Solution: Hybrid Navigation System

### 1. Index Screen Navigation (RESTORED)
- **Handles unauthenticated users**: Navigates to login screen
- **Handles app startup**: Initial navigation based on stored tokens
- **Avoids conflicts**: Doesn't navigate authenticated users to dashboard (leaves that to login screen)

### 2. Login Screen Navigation (KEEPS EXISTING)
- **Handles post-authentication**: Navigates to dashboard after successful login
- **Reacts to auth state changes**: Immediate navigation when user becomes authenticated

## Fixed Navigation Flow

```
App Startup:
1. app/index.tsx loads
2. Checks auth state (initialized, persistenceRestored, loading)
3. If NOT authenticated → Navigate to /login/loginScreen
4. If authenticated → Let login screen handle dashboard navigation

User Authentication:
1. User signs in on login screen
2. Authentication succeeds → Redux updated
3. Login screen useEffect detects auth change
4. Login screen → Navigate to /(tabs)/dashboard

User Restart with Saved Tokens:
1. app/index.tsx loads
2. TokenAuthService restores tokens
3. User becomes authenticated
4. Index navigation lets login screen handle dashboard navigation
```

## Expected Behavior Now
- ✅ **App startup**: Should navigate to login screen (no more stuck loading)
- ✅ **After login**: Should navigate to dashboard via login screen logic
- ✅ **Token restoration**: Should work via existing index logic
- ✅ **No conflicts**: Each navigation system handles different scenarios

## Key Fix
The main issue was that `app/index.tsx` was completely disabled, so unauthenticated users could never reach the login screen. Now it handles initial navigation while letting the login screen handle post-authentication navigation.

The app should no longer be stuck on the loading screen!
