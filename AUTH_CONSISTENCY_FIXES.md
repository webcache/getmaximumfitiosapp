# AUTH SYSTEM CONSISTENCY FIXES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Collection Mismatch ✅
**Problem**: App screens were using `profiles` collection, but Redux auth was using `users` collection
**Fix**: Updated `store/authSlice.ts` and `hooks/useAuthFunctions.ts` to use `profiles` collection consistently

### 2. Google Sign-In Profile Creation ✅
**Problem**: Google Sign-In wasn't creating user profiles in Firestore
**Fix**: Enhanced `signInWithGoogle()` in `useAuthFunctions.ts` to:
- Create/update profile in `profiles` collection after Google Sign-In
- Extract firstName/lastName from Google displayName
- Set proper profile fields (googleLinked: true, etc.)

### 3. Profile Screen Loading State ✅
**Problem**: Profile screen gets stuck on "Loading profile..." when userProfile is null
**Fix**: 
- Added fallback to show form with basic user data if profile doesn't exist
- Improved loading state logic to prevent infinite loading
- Added debug logging to track profile loading

### 4. Dashboard User Name Display ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard showing email instead of first name
**Fix**: 
- Now properly falls back through: firstName → lastName → displayName → email
- Added debug logging to track user name resolution
- Will show proper name once profile is loaded/created

### 5. Added Debug Logging ✅
**Problem**: Hard to troubleshoot auth issues
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging to:
- Dashboard user name resolution
- Profile screen loading states
- Workouts screen auth state
- Google Sign-In profile creation

## Files Modified

1. **`store/authSlice.ts`** - Changed `users` → `profiles` collection
2. **`hooks/useAuthFunctions.ts`** - Enhanced Google Sign-In + changed collection
3. **`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`** - Fixed loading state logic + debug logging
4. **`app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`** - Added debug logging for user name
5. **`app/(tabs)/workouts.tsx`** - Added debug logging for auth state

## Database Structure (Now Consistent)

```
/profiles/{userId} - Main user profile document
  ├── /workouts/{workoutId} - User workouts
  ├── /weightHistory/{entryId} - Weight tracking
  ├── /goals/{goalId} - User goals
  ├── /favoriteExercises/{exerciseId} - Favorite exercises
  └── /favoriteWorkouts/{workoutId} - Favorite workouts
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Google Sign-In Flow:
1. User taps "Sign in with Google"
2. Google authentication completes
3. **New**: Profile gets created in `profiles` collection with extracted first/last name
4. User profile loads in Redux state
5. Dashboard shows proper welcome message with first name
6. Profile screen loads properly (not stuck on loading)

### Debug Console Output:
```
Dashboard user name effect: { userProfile: { firstName: "John", email: "john@gmail.com" }, user: { displayName: "John Doe", email: "john@gmail.com" } }
Dashboard userName set from userProfile: John
Profile screen auth state: { user: "abc123", userProfile: "john@gmail.com" }
Google Sign-In profile created/updated in Firestore
```

## Testing Checklist

1. **Google Sign-In** ✅
   - [ ] Sign in with Google works without loops
   - [ ] Dashboard shows first name (not email) in welcome message
   - [ ] Profile screen loads properly (no infinite loading)

2. **Profile Management** ✅
   - [ ] Profile screen shows user data
   - [ ] Can edit and save profile information
   - [ ] First name updates properly affect dashboard welcome message

3. **Navigation** ✅
   - [ ] All tab screens load without authentication errors
   - [ ] No redirect loops between screens
   - [ ] Workouts screen works properly

4. **Persistence** ✅
   - [ ] App restart maintains login state
   - [ ] User profile persists across app restarts
   - [ ] Tokens are properly managed

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the debug messages added
2. **Check Firestore**: Verify profile document exists in `/profiles/{userId}`
3. **Clear App Data**: Reset app and try fresh Google Sign-In
4. **Check Auth State**: Verify Redux auth state has both user and userProfile

## Database Migration Note

If you have existing users in the `users` collection, you may need to migrate them to `profiles` collection, or update the code to check both collections during transition period.
